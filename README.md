### How To Contribute

* Once you are added as a contributor
- Clone the repository
- Be sure to pull down the latest changes before creating your branch `git pull` 
- Create your branch `git checkout -b <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>` (Ex: `git checkout -b feature/nav-bar`) (Feel free to prefix your branches with feature or bugfix)
- Commit your changes locally `git add .` (This adds all changes made)
- Add your commit message that sums up the work you have done `git commit -m "changes you made here"` (Ex: `git commit -m "added nav bar style and tests"`)
- Push up your changes `git push` usually on the first commit you'll need to run `git push -u origin <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>`
- Create a pull request of your changes for review. Visit Github and you will now see a green "Compare & pull request" button on the repo. Check that your changes are accurate, that you are pushing to the correct branch, and include a meaningful description of your changes.
